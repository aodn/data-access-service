    "abstract": "The ACORN facility is producing NetCDF files with wind direction and short wave direction and spread  data for each site every hour. These are obtained using software supplied by Seaview Sensing Ltd which applies the method described in Wyatt et al, 1996, Maximum Likelihood estimation of the directional distribution of 0.53Hz ocean waves, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 14, 591-603, 1996. Directions are all towards which the wave is propagating or the wind is blowing.  Each value has a corresponding quality control flag where a value of 0 means that the data have passed all the standard Seaview Sensing QC procedures and a values of 1 means the data have passed additional experimental Seavew Sensing QC procedures.
