    "abstract": "Remote sensing reflectance from DALEC0001 on board AIMS RV Solander. Spectra have been quality controlled based on attitude (pitch, roll, angle relative to bow) and processed to remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). Glint correction has been implemented as described by Brando et al (2016). Data are included as individual spectra, however, it is recommended that users select suitable temporal or spatial sample sets and calculate the mean of the 5-25 percentile range to minimize the effects of surface roughness in the estimation of Rrs (Hooker et al. 2002,  Zibordi et al. 2004).\n Voyage information for the AIMS vessel Solander can be found at https://apps.aims.gov.au/voyage-tracker/vessel/2 Voyage reports and underway data for Marine National Facility (e.g. Southern Surveyor) can be found at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/, using the Voyage_number attribute to identify the voyage.

A flag value of 1 indicates that the solar zenith angle exceeds 50 degrees.\nA flag value of 2 indicates that the sun is within 10 deg of zenith and thus data are likely to be affected by residual sun glint.\nFor precision use, data should be excluded where Rrs_xflags>0\nData have not been filtered for cloud.",

Wind speed measurements are not always available during DALEC deployment. Where wind data were not available, forecast wind speed from the ACCESS-R (regional) model was used (http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/charts/about/about_access.shtml). If this was not available a default value of 5kt was used.  This is indicated by the wind_speed attribute \"wind_source\" which has values of \"Measured\", \"Modelled\" or \"Default\". In overcast conditions, Mobley (1999) recommends using rho=0.028. Such a situation will be indicated in the comment field.",
