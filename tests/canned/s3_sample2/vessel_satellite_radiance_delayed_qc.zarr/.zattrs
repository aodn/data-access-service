Spectra are triplets of Downwelling irradiance (Ed), Upwelling radiance from the water surface (Lu), Sky radiance (Lsky). Ancillary attitude data for the DALEC are pitch (degrees), pitch standard deviation (degrees), roll (degrees), roll standard deviation (degrees) and gear position (degrees from the bow). \nVoyage information for the AIMS vessel Solander can be found at https://apps.aims.gov.au/voyage-tracker/vessel/2 Voyage reports and underway data for Marine National Facility (e.g. Southern Surveyor) can be found at https://www.marine.csiro.au/data/trawler/, using the Voyage_number attribute to identify the voyage.
